It can be read in sequence, or users can use the navigation panel on the LEFT to select the section and functionality they are interested in.\nThis guide precedes the completion of tool functionality, as part of our iterative release practice, and is being updated as features are released. Where text is yet to be released, or sections relate to features still under development, this is indicated by the following symbol: .\nComplementary guides are provided for educational users [] and web developers [].\nFurther information on the project and project team which created the MAPS tool can be found at the project website https://micronutrient.support/. A summary of our co-design process, implemented to design and test the MAPS tool, can be found at [].\nSee Knuth (1984) for additional discussion of literate programming.\n\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnuth, Donald E. 1984. “Literate Programming.” Comput.
