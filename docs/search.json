    "text": "The MAPS project (Nov 2019 – present) has co-created a web-hosted tool to estimate micronutrient inadequacies and explore pathways to improve nutrition. This was in response to an unmet need articulated by stakeholders at the project design phase. The premise is to unlock, and make available, sub-national insights of relevance to nutritional assessments both currently, and under future scenarios. MAPS’ geographic scope is for nations in sub–Saharan Africa. Feature release has been iterative through the development of the tool. The simplified user journey is summarised below.\n\n\n\nSimplified user journey through the MAPS tool features\n\n\nUser entry points are provided at https://maps.micronutrient.support/maps-tool (and as shown below) which are QuickMAPS and cost and effectiveness modelling.\n\n\n\nThe options to enter via QuickMAPS (lower left of screenshot) or Cost & Effectiveness (lower right of screenshot) available on navigating to the tool.\n\n\nQuickMAPS removes the need for complex data modelling skills that would be otherwise required to interact with national, or subnational, views of data which provide information on nutrient availability in nations. QuickMAPS also enables viualisation of information on the projections of nutrient availability at the national scale to the year 2050.\nCost & effectiveness features provide modelling frameworks, visualisations and download for large-scale food fortification (LSFF), and for agricultural biofortification using either crop varieties or fertilisers . Users can create multiple models, and compare outputs. Cost and effectiveness modelling can also be called from within QuickMAPS.\nFurther information on each of these key features is provided in the sections below.\nOur co-design summary explains selection of our modelling, features and design priorities [ ]. This also documents of the features that could not be developed under the current iteration of MAPS, but which have been requested during user testing. This report provides a link for users to submit any additional feature requests, although the project does not currently (2024) have the funding to pursue these.",

These options are only available where data is loaded for the selected country and micronutrient combination.\nThe MAPS tool will then automatically select the most spatially disaggregated data available and most recent data available (area D on the index map above). Thus, if subnational data are available, via a household consumption and expenditure survey, the tool will default to displaying these data. If this is not available, the most recent food balance sheet data will be selected, and provide a national overview.\nWhere biomarkers are available, this option will be enabled and can be chosen by the user. This functionality will only be ‘live’ where the biomarker data is loaded for the combination of the country and the micronutrient. See the biomarker section  for more information.\nOn selection of the data the user wishes to view, the system will then model the data and present these in a dashboard view as described below.\nThe selection side bar will automatically close to the left of the screen to maximise the screen area for viewing the results. The selection side bar can be restored at any time by clicking on this icon , found on the top left of the screen area.",

The example below shows that of calcium in South Africa.\nThese are described with reference to the index image below.\nThe ‘baseline’ header (area A on the index image) confirms this to be the QuickMAPS baseline view for the chosen country and micronutrient (area B).\nThe title banner (area C) provides information on the country, micronutrient, and confirmation that food systems data is being used.\nThe title banner then also provides more detail on the food composition data which the tool has matched to the information on food availability/apparent intake. The extent to which the foods have been matched to food composition data is provided (area D), and the proportion of foods matched to individual composition tables is provided. This also, importantly, summarises the proportion of foods which were not matched and thus were not included in the model outputs on the screen below. Further details on these are able to be seen by expanding the window (using the ‘view details’ arrow immediately to the right of the letter D).\nAdditional information on the food composition data being used is shown in the drop-down area (E on the index image), with the number of items, and their contribution by weight, used from each source dataset. This also shows the number, and proportion by weight, of items not matched in the MAPS tool and therefore excluded from the model results shown in the screen below. These data are provided to support methodological transparency.\nEither two or four ‘cards’ are then presented on the page, depending on whether the tool has national scale food balance sheet data, or sub-national household consumption and expenditure survey data loaded.",
