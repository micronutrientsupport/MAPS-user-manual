All three links lead to exactly the same version of the tool.\nThe MAPS tool has been optimised for screen sizes typically found with desktop and laptop devices, rather than smaller mobile devices. Using smaller devices is possible, but will not provide the intended appearance of the interfaces. The tool will work in widely used commercial operating systems and web browsers (as at 2024).\nAccess is free of charge and does not require users to log-in. Users of the full scope of functionality, i.e. the cost & effectiveness modelling, and/or bring-your-own data [], may prefer to create a user account in order to save for a later date their own input data and models."
