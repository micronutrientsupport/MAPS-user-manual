# Using QuickMAPS

## Accessing QuickMAPS

QuickMAPS can be accessed directly through <https://maps.micronutrient.support/maps-tool> or the alias <https://www.maps.africa/>. No log in is required.

## Initial selection menu

The following screen will appear on entering QuickMAPS. The '*Welcome to Quick MAPS*' pop up window provides more information and a tour feature. Once completed or dismissed this can be restored at any time by using the icon ![Pop up MAPS welcome and tour](images/MAPS_icons1.png){width="23" height="21"} on the lower right side of the screen.

The screen will then show the following view - which provides the user with the choice of country, micronutrient and, where applicable, food system or biomarker data.

## Country and micronutrient selection

The **country** of interest can be selected from the drop-down menu, or the interactive map (areas A and B on the index map below).

The **micronutrient** of interest can be selected from the drop-down menu (area C on the index map below).

Once the country and micronutrient are selected, the MAPS tool will automatically select the most spatially disaggregated data available and most recent data available (area C on the index map above). Thus, if subnational data are available, via a household consumption and expenditure survey, the tool will default to displaying these data. If this is not available, the most recent food balance sheet data will be selected, and provide a national overview.

Where biomarkers are available, this option will be enabled and can be chosen by the user. This functionality will only be 'live' where the biomarker data is loaded for the combination of the country and the micronutrient. See the biomarker section ![work-in-progress](images/WiP_purplespanner.svg) for more information.

On selection of the data the user wishes to view, the system will then model the data and present these in a dashboard view as described below.

The selection side bar will automatically close to the left of the screen to maximise the screen area for viewing the results. The selection side bar can be restored at any time by clicking on this icon ![Icon to restore the selection side bar](images/SideBar_closedviewicon.png){width="17" height="21"}, found on the top left of the screen area.

## Changing the initial selection of country and / or micronutrient

The side bar can be re--opened using the icon ![](images/SideBar_closedviewicon.png){width="14"} and the steps shown [above](https://help.micronutrient.support/QuickMAPS.html#country-and-micronutrient-selection) used to view any different permutation of the countries and nutrients for which data is loaded.

## Baseline -- contextual information shown on all data views for food systems data modelling

The view which next appears has default components which appear on all pages, irrespective of whether sub-national, or national, data have been retrieved. These are shown in the index image below.

{insert index image for food sys data visualisations}

The title banner (area A on the index image) provides information on the country, micronutrient, and confirmation that food systems data is being used.

The lower part of the title banner provides a summary of the food composition data which has been matched to the food systems data (area B on the index image). This can be further revealed using the down arrow to provide details of the food composition tables which have been used.
