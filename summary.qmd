# Overview of the MAPS tool features

The MAPS project (Nov 2019 -- present) has co-created a web-hosted tool to estimate micronutrient inadequacies and explore pathways to improve nutrition. This was in response to an unmet need articulated by stakeholders at the project design phase. The premise is to unlock, and make available, sub-national insights of relevance to nutritional assessments both currently, and under future scenarios. MAPS' geographic scope is for nations in sub--Saharan Africa. Feature release has been iterative through the development of the tool. The simplified user journey is summarised below.

User entry points are provided at <https://maps.micronutrient.support/maps-tool> (and as shown below) which are **QuickMAPS** and **cost and effectiveness** modelling.

**QuickMAPS** removes the need for complex data modelling skills that would be otherwise required to interact with national, or subnational, views of data which provide information on nutrient availability in nations. QuickMAPS also enables viualisation of information on the projections of nutrient availability at the national scale to the year 2050.

**Cost & effectiveness** features provide modelling frameworks, visualisations and download options modelling interventions. This can be large-scale food fortification (LSFF), or biofortification ![](images/WiP_purplespanner.svg) using either crop varieties or fertilisers. Users can create multiple models, and compare outputs. Cost and effectiveness modelling can also be called from within QuickMAPS.

Further information on each of these key features is provided in the sections below.

Our **co-design** summary explains selection of our modelling, features and design priorities \[![work-in-progress](images/WiP_purplespanner.svg) \]. This also documents of the features that could not be developed under the current iteration of MAPS, but which have been requested during user testing. This report provides a link for users to submit any additional feature requests, although the project does not currently (2024) have the funding to pursue these.
