# Accessing, and returning to, the MAPS tool

The MAPS tool can be accessed directly from <https://maps.micronutrient.support/> or <https://maps.micronutrient.support/maps-tool>, and via our shortcut <https://www.maps.africa/>. All three links lead to exactly the same version of the tool.

The MAPS tool has been optimised for screen sizes typically found with desktop and laptop devices, rather than smaller mobile devices. Using smaller devices is possible, but will not provide the intended user experience of the interfaces. The tool will work in widely used commercial operating systems and web browsers (as at 2024).

Access is free of charge and does not require users to log-in. Users of the full scope of functionality, i.e. the cost & effectiveness modelling, and/or bring-your-own data \[![work-in-progress](images/WiP_purplespanner.svg)\], may prefer to create a user account in order to save for a later date their own input data and models.

The current version of the tool is \<*insert link*\>, and **returning users** may need to check a locally cached earlier version is not being used. If this is the case, follow your browser instructions to clear the cache and refresh your version of the MAPS tool.
