# QuickMAPS 3: Projections

The projections page takes the country and nutrient selected in the 'Baseline' page of QuickMAPS, and provides national-scale projections of nutrient availability where these are available. To alter the nutrient availability, follow the instructions to change the country and/or nutrient which can be found in section [4.4](https://help.micronutrient.support/QuickMAPS.html#changing-the-initial-selection-of-country-and-or-micronutrient).

## Information banner

The information banner at the top of the page is structured in a very similar way to that of the Baseline page: an example is shown below of the projection page.

The information provided on this page is described using the index image below.

Area A: confirms the projections tab is selected

Area B: A summary of the country, nutrient, food system data (as for Baseline), and the default model selected which is SSP2 (see below).

Area C: The 2010 estimate is compared to the threshold used in the Baseline page, to explore the difference between these data and when the projections are expected to reach the threshold.

The default model used is SSP2; further information can be retrieved about the Shared Socioeconomic Projections (SSP) by selecting the text "Learn more" on the right of area B. When selected an explanatory pop-up can be viewed, as shown below.

## Nutrient availability projection graph

Below the information banner, the default view presents the nutrient availability projection graph, which includes all three SSPs (as described above).
