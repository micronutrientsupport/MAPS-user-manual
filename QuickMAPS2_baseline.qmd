# QuickMAPS 2: Baseline page

The view which next appears has default components which appear on all pages, irrespective of whether sub-national, or national, data have been retrieved.

## Baseline data information section

The format of the upper part of the screen is consistent for all food systems data in QuickMAPS. The example below shows that of calcium in South Africa.

These are described with reference to the index image below.

The 'baseline' header (area A on the index image) confirms this to be the QuickMAPS baseline view for the chosen country and micronutrient (area B).

The title banner (area C) provides information on the country, micronutrient, and confirmation that food systems data is being used.

The title banner then also provides more detail on the food composition data which the tool has matched to the information on food availability/apparent intake. The extent to which the foods have been matched to food composition data is provided (area D), and the proportion of foods matched to individual composition tables is provided. This also, importantly, summarises the proportion of foods which were not matched and thus were not included in the model outputs on the screen below. Further details on these are able to be seen by expanding the window (using the 'view details' arrow immediately to the right of the letter D).

Additional information on the food composition data being used is shown in the drop-down area (E on the index image), with the number of items, and their contribution by weight, used from each source dataset. This also shows the number, and proportion by weight, of items not matched in the MAPS tool and therefore excluded from the model results shown in the screen below. These data are provided to support methodological transparency.

Either two or four 'cards' are then presented on the page, depending on whether the tool has national scale food balance sheet data, or sub-national household consumption and expenditure survey data loaded.

## Geographic presentation

A map of the data is shown, on the top left when in default presentation mode. Where food balance sheet data is presented, then there is only one summary value for the whole country (reflecting the input data, see methods ![](images/WiP_purplespanner.svg)). Where sub-national data is shown, the data is disaggregated to the first administrative level. An example of each of these is shown below.

In both cases the polygons on the map (i.e. the shaded area(s) within the country of interest) can also be interacted with by hovering over them until a pop-up appears, containing numerical summaries.
